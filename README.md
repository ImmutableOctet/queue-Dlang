# queue-Dlang
A basic FIFO queue module for the D programming language.

Not a double ended queue, but it gets the job done. I made this as an introduction to the language, so I can only imagine it isn't the most "standard" thing in the world. *This is a rough port/rewrite of my original ['queue' Monkey module](https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet/queue).*
